# Odyssey
Odessey is a 2D platforming game that I embarked on with my friend for the Orbital project. This was the first software development project that we tackled since starting university, so the quality of the game may not be the best. But we still did try to make it as fun as possible:D

If you would like to try this game out, just follow the steps listed below.

  <li> Download the zip file from the github release page or this link [https://github.com/Imerbear/Odyssey/releases/tag/v1.0] </li>

  <li> Open the folder produced by the zip file</li>
  <li> Locate the file with the name "Odyssey - Shortcut"</li>
  <li> Double click that shortcut and the game will launch</li>
  <li> Have fun with the game!</li>
</ol>
